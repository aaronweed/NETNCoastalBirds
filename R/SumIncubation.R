#' @description Brings in the raw incubation survey data from \code{\link{importCBBData}} and
#'  summarizes the data for plotting and analysis of DCCO and Gulls (no terns). Summarizes counts by day or by year 
#'  (sum, mean, max, and min of daily surveys) from the primary survey conducted by the lead biologist.  
#'  If you specify  \code{ByObserver}= \code{TRUE} and \code{time} = "date", all nests will be summed by each observer.
#' @section Warning:
#' Unless \code{df} is specified, the user must have an Access backend entered as 'NETNCB' in Windows ODBC manager.
#' @param df Dataframe. Requires dataframe exported from NETN's data package imported via \code{\link{importCBBData}} from view "qry_Dataset_2_Survey_Incubation". If \code{df} 
#' is \code{NULL}, the user must have an Access backend entered as 'NETNCB' in Windows ODBC manager in order to import from \code{\link{GetIncubationData}}.
#' @param time Character string equal to "date" or "year". Value must be provided; there is
#' no default. Choose to summarize counts by "date" or "year". Summing by date will sum counts across 
#' segments of each island for each date. When \code{time= year}, summarizes counts (mean, max, min, and sum) across all surveys conducted 
#' in that year. Note that some surveys were repeated in the same year so mean is best to use for reporting because it accounts for seasonal variation in repeat counts. 
#' @param species To subset data by species, use  "DCCO","GBBG","HERG". Defaults
#' to providing output for all species.
#' @param output Character string equal to "graph" or "table". 
#' Defaults to long format (output= "graph") ready for ggplot and the \code{\link{PlotBirds}}
#' function. For wide format use "table".
#' @param ByObserver Character string equal to \code{"yes"} or \code{"no"}.
#' If "yes" and \code{time} = "date", the function will output the survey data counted by each observer for 
#' each island segment on each date. Sums counts across multiple observations by same 
#' observer at each segment. Defaults to "no".
#' @param segment Logical. To summarize data at the survey (island-segment) scale (\code{TRUE}) or island-scale (\code{FALSE})
#'  Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' @return Returns a \code{data.frame} with the raw and effort-adjusted counts of Gulls and DCCO incubating nests observed 
#' during boat-based incubation surveys per island, life stage, and time.
